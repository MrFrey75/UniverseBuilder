# ðŸ§° Developer Guide

 Coming soon

 We're assembling a thorough developer guide to make contributing fast and friendly. It will include:

 - Project structure and architecture overview
 - Local development setup (API + React UI)
 - Data layer (MongoDB, repositories)
 - Coding standards, linting, and formatting
 - Testing (unit, integration, E2E) and coverage
 - Debugging tips and common pitfalls
 - CI/CD overview

 Until then:

 - Start with the README for the big picture: ./README.md
 - Watch progress and open tasks in the Roadmap: ./ROADMAP.md (Phase 15 active)
 - Share feedback or ask questions via GitHub Issues/Discussions

 Status: Preparing Beta (docs landing shortly)
