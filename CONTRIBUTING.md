2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/WorldBuilder.git
   cd WorldBuilder
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote** (to stay in sync with the main repo):
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/MrFrey75/WorldBuilder.git
   ```
4. **Create a feature branch** (see [Branch Strategy](#branch-strategy) below).

## üí° How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? Please open a **GitHub Issue** using the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Include:
- Clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Screenshots/logs if applicable
- Environment (OS, .NET version, Node version, etc.)

### Requesting Features

Include:
- Clear description of the feature
- Motivation and use case
- Proposed implementation (if applicable)
- Examples or mockups (if relevant)

### Improving Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome! To contribute:

3. Submit a Pull Request with a clear description

---

## üîÄ Branch Strategy

We follow a simple branching model:

- **`main`** ‚Äì Stable, production-ready code. Direct commits are restricted.
- **Feature branches** ‚Äì Create from `main` for new features, bug fixes, or documentation:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
  # or for bug fixes:
  git checkout -b fix/descriptive-name
  # or for documentation:
  git checkout -b docs/descriptive-name
  ```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/add-xyz` ‚Äì New feature
- `fix/resolve-xyz` ‚Äì Bug fix
- `docs/update-xyz` ‚Äì Documentation
- `refactor/improve-xyz` ‚Äì Code refactoring
- `test/add-xyz` ‚Äì Test improvements

---

## üíª Coding Standards

### C# (.NET) Backend

- **Naming conventions:**
  - Classes, methods, properties: `PascalCase`
  - Private fields: `_camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Code style:**
  - Follow [Microsoft C# Coding Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
  - Use meaningful, descriptive names
  - Keep methods focused and concise
  - Add XML documentation comments for public APIs
- **Organization:**
  - Use the Repository Pattern for data access
  - Separate concerns: Models, Services, Controllers
  - Implement validation at the service layer

### React / TypeScript Frontend

- **Naming conventions:**
  - Components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
  - Files (utilities): `camelCase` (e.g., `dateUtils.ts`)
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  - CSS classes: `kebab-case`
- **Code style:**
  - Use functional components and hooks (no class components)
  - Prefer `const` over `let` or `var`
  - Use TypeScript strict mode
  - Keep components small and reusable
  - Add JSDoc comments for complex logic
- **File structure:**
  - Keep related files in directories
  - Separate components, utilities, and styles

### General

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for JSON/YAML, project defaults for code)
- Avoid hard-coded values; use configuration or constants
- Write meaningful commit messages (see [Commit Messages](#commit-messages))
- Keep lines reasonably short (aim for < 120 characters)

---

## ‚úÖ Testing

All contributions should include appropriate tests.

### C# Tests

- Use **xUnit** for unit tests
- Place tests in `tests/UniverseBuilder.Core.Tests` and `tests/UniverseBuilder.Api.Tests`
- Aim for **80%+ code coverage** in the Core library
- Run tests locally before pushing:
  ```bash
  dotnet test WorldBuilder.sln
  ```

### React Tests

- Use **Jest** and **React Testing Library**
- Place tests alongside components (e.g., `Component.test.tsx`)
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Run tests before pushing:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

### E2E Tests

- Use **Playwright** or **Cypress** for critical user flows
- Automate in CI/CD pipeline

## üìù Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Short summary (50 characters or less)

More detailed explanation (72 characters per line) if needed.
Explain what changed and why.

Fixes #123        (reference related issues)
Related #456
```

**Examples:**
```
Add hierarchical location filtering
Fix race condition in event timeline
Docs: update quick start prerequisites
Refactor: simplify repository queries
Test: add edge cases for date conversion
```

---

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch** with the latest `main`:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/descriptive-name
   ```

3. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Use the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
   - Link related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`)
   - Provide a clear description of changes
   - Include screenshots/videos if applicable (UI changes)

4. **Respond to reviews:**
   - Address feedback promptly
   - Request re-review after making changes
   - Keep discussion professional and constructive

5. **Merge:**
   - A maintainer will merge once approved
   - Squash or rebase as needed (maintainer discretion)

---

## üß™ CI/CD Checks

All PRs must pass automated checks:

- ‚úÖ **Build:** C# solution builds successfully
- ‚úÖ **Tests:** All tests pass (C#, React, E2E)
- ‚úÖ **Code coverage:** Maintains or improves coverage targets
- ‚úÖ **Linting:** Code passes style checks

---

## üìö Documentation

When making changes that affect functionality:

- Update relevant `.md` files in the repo
- Update code documentation and comments
- Add/update examples if applicable
- Consider updating the Roadmap if it's a major feature

---

## üéØ Development Roadmap

Check the [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for planned phases and current focus areas. We organize work into phases:

- **Phases 1-14:** Core feature development (foundation, entities, visualization, testing)
- **Phase 15:** Beta Testing & Deployment (current focus)
- **Phases 16+:** Post-1.0 features (customization, multi-user, integrations)

Feel free to tackle open issues or propose work aligned with the roadmap!
